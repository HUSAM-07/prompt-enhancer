## üö¶ Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run app-v3.py
```

### Basic Workflow

1. **Enter Your Prompt**: Start with your existing prompt in the editor
2. **Add Examples** (Optional): Provide input/output examples for better accuracy
3. **Auto-Improve**: Click the button to let Claude enhance your prompt
4. **Review Improvements**: See what changes were made and why
5. **Test & Evaluate**: Run tests with ideal outputs to measure performance
6. **Iterate**: Provide feedback and re-improve until satisfied

## üìù Usage Examples

### Example 1: Classification Prompt Enhancement

**Original Prompt:**
```
classify the sentiment of the text
```

**Enhanced Prompt:**
```xml
<task>
<thinking>
I need to analyze the sentiment of the provided text. I should consider the overall tone, specific words indicating emotion, and context to determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.
</thinking>

<instructions>
Please classify the sentiment of the following text:

<input>{{input}}</input>

Analyze the text carefully and provide one of these classifications:
- Positive
- Negative  
- Neutral

<output_format>
Sentiment: [Your classification]
Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]
Key indicators: [List 2-3 specific phrases that support your classification]
</output_format>
</instructions>
</task>
```

### Example 2: Summarization with Word Limit

**Original Prompt:**
```
summarize this article in 100 words
```

**Enhanced Prompt:**
```xml
<task>
<thinking>
I need to create a concise summary that captures the main points of the article while strictly adhering to the 100-word limit. I should identify key themes, important facts, and conclusions.
</thinking>

<instructions>
Create a summary of the following article:

<input>{{input}}</input>

<constraints>
- The summary MUST be exactly 100 words (tolerance: ¬±5 words)
- Include the main topic, key points, and conclusion
- Maintain the original tone and perspective
- Use clear, concise language
</constraints>

<output_format>
Summary: [Your 100-word summary here]
Word count: [Exact number]
</output_format>
</instructions>
</task>
```

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with a basic prompt and let the system enhance it
2. **Provide Examples**: The more examples you provide, the better the enhancement
3. **Use Feedback**: Be specific about what's not working in the feedback field
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Use the evaluation system with diverse test cases
5. **Track Performance**: Monitor the analytics to see improvement over time

## üìä Analytics & Insights

The Analytics tab provides:
- Performance trends over time
- Technique effectiveness ratings
- Common failure patterns
- Improvement suggestions based on evaluation data

## üîß Advanced Features

### Variable Substitution
Use `{{variable_name}}` syntax in prompts for dynamic content insertion during testing.

### Export Functionality
- Export prompt history as JSON
- Export examples for reuse
- Export evaluation results as CSV for analysis

### Version Control
- Automatic versioning of all prompt iterations
- Rollback capability to previous versions
- Comparison between versions
